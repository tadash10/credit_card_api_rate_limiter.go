# credit_card_api_rate_limiter.go

Overview

This documentation provides an overview of the Rate-Limited API Server, a Go script that implements rate limiting for API calls to the credit card database. The rate limiter helps prevent brute-force attacks and unauthorized access by restricting the number of requests a user or IP address can make within a specific time frame.
Features

The Rate-Limited API Server includes the following features:

    Rate Limiting: The server enforces rate limiting to restrict the number of requests that can be made within a specific time window. Requests exceeding the allowed limit will be rate-limited with appropriate HTTP status codes.

    Graceful Shutdown: The server can be gracefully shut down using OS signals (e.g., SIGINT, SIGTERM) or a key press. This ensures that existing requests are completed, and new incoming requests are rejected during shutdown.

    Rate Limit Headers: The server includes rate limit headers in the HTTP responses to provide transparency to API clients about their remaining request quota and the rate limit window.

    Configurability: The server's rate limit parameters (rate and capacity) are configurable through command-line flags, allowing users to set their desired rate and capacity values.

    Error Handling: The server incorporates proper error handling for critical sections, such as starting the server and shutting it down gracefully. Errors are logged for better visibility into the server's behavior.

    Logging: The server logs important events and potential issues to provide better debugging and monitoring capabilities.

Project Structure

The Rate-Limited API Server repository is organized as follows:

go

rate-limited-api-server/
├── config.example.yml
├── Dockerfile
├── .gitignore
├── main.go
├── ratelimiter.go
├── server.go
└── config.go

    main.go: The main entry point of the application that sets up the rate limiter, starts the HTTP server, and handles graceful shutdown.

    ratelimiter.go: File containing the implementation of the rate limiter algorithm.

    server.go: File with the HTTP server configuration and routing, including the handling of rate-limited requests.

    config.go: File containing the functions for parsing and validating the configuration from command-line flags.

    config.example.yml: An example configuration file that users can use as a template to set up their own configuration. This file helps users understand the configuration options available.

    Dockerfile: If applicable, a Dockerfile to build a Docker image of the application for easy deployment. Dockerizing the application allows for consistency across different environments and simplifies the deployment process.

    .gitignore: A file listing files and directories that should be ignored by version control. This ensures that unnecessary files, such as IDE-specific files and build artifacts, are not included in the repository.

Usage
Configuration

Users can configure the Rate-Limited API Server using command-line flags when running the application. The available configuration options are:

    -rate: Sets the requests per second rate limit. The rate specifies the maximum number of requests allowed per second (default: 10.0).

    -capacity: Sets the request capacity. The capacity represents the total number of requests that can be allowed within the rate limit window (default: 20).

Example usage:

go

$ go run main.go -rate 5.0 -capacity 50

Running the Server

To run the Rate-Limited API Server, navigate to the project's root directory and use the go run command:

go

$ go run main.go

The server will start and listen on port 8080 by default. To access the server, make HTTP requests to http://localhost:8080.
Graceful Shutdown

To gracefully shut down the server, send an OS signal (e.g., SIGINT, SIGTERM) or press Ctrl+C in the terminal where the server is running.
Testing

Unit tests for the rate limiter and other relevant functions can be found in the respective *_test.go files. To run the tests, use the go test command:

shell

$ go test

Dockerization (if applicable)

If you prefer to run the Rate-Limited API Server in a Docker container, use the provided Dockerfile to build the Docker image:



$ docker build -t rate-limited-api-server .

Once the image is built, you can run the server in a Docker container:



$ docker run -p 8080:8080 rate-limited-api-server

Conclusion

The Rate-Limited API Server provides a secure and performant solution to protect the credit card database from brute-force attacks and unauthorized access. The combination of rate limiting, graceful shutdown, and logging features ensures a smooth and transparent experience for API clients. The script's configurability and robust error handling make it easy to customize and maintain in different environments.
